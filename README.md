# NETMaui_Shadow_Bug
.NET MAUI Shadow Bug reproduction project

This is a bug reproduction project for NET MAUI.
This project reproduces a bug where shadows are rendered differently on different devices.
I have tested this on 3 devices:
  - Pixel 5 (Android 13) - shadow settings are applied right
  - Xiaomi 11T (Android 13) (MIUI 14.0.4 Global) - shadow radius has no effect
  - Samsung J6 (Android 10) - shadow settings are applied right
